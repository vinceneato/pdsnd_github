README

This is a README for Vincent Nieto's bikeshare.py program. This is an interactive program made to explore US bikeshare data for the Udacity nanodegree python project.

I used a few references that helped me write this program, aside from the tutorial videos and quizzes:

1. https://pandas.pydata.org/
2. Python Pocket Reference: Python In Your Pocket (Pocket Reference (O'Reilly)) Fifth Edition by Mark Lutz
3. Learning Python, 5th Edition Fifth Edition by Mark Lutz
